This exercise works the transverse abs, which run from your sides to the front of your abs. As you walk, pull your bellybutton in, like you're drawing it towards your spine.Is 3 exercises for abs enough?
                        Within a training session, we recommend including between 1 and 3 different ab exercises, but no more than that in most cases, as doing more than 3 ab movements in one session is likely just a needless burning of potential exercise variations you can save for later mesocycles.</b>

                        On average, you would need to perform 3 – 4 chest exercises per workout if your goal is growing your chest through muscle hypertrophy and 2 – 3 exercises if  you're aiming to build strength. The exact amount of chest exercises you should do per workout ultimately depends on your fitness level, goals, and preferences.</b>

It hits the traps, lats and lower back all in one exercise, and it can be overloaded to boost back development.While the squat, deadlift, and dumbbell bench press are arguably the three best exercises you can do in the gym, that doesn't mean you should do them exclusively. Adding in several exercises will flesh out a complete and well-rounded program.</a>

                        A full-body workout means many groups of muscles are working at once. This helps to achieve greater workout results from a lesser number of exercises. Because these are more strenuous exercise than usual, the muscles require 2-3 days to recover from all the strain they endure. Hence, these must not be attempted daily.cFull-body workouts are a great training split to follow. However, doing a full-body workout every day is not ideal. This is because you'll be stimulating your muscles in one session, and to do this daily will not give them enough time to recover. 2-3 days is a good rule of thumb to follow.
